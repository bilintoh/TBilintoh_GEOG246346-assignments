`tb3462a` is the second package I am developing for the coursework componenet of GEOG346 (GEOSPATIAL Analysis with R).

It is currently a function called `mycalc` and executed as
follows:
```{r}
library(tb346a2)
x <- 1:5
x
y <- 2:6
y
mycalc(x=x,y=y,"sum")




```

I will be adding others, and updating this vignette as we go.
